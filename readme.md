WeatherDesk Installer
=====================

I've done nothing. This is my one-line installer for WeatherDesk, an awesome
app over on GitLab at https://gitlab.com/bharadwaj-raju/WeatherDesk ,
by @bharadwaj-raju , who must be a really great human.

Go on over there to find out what this is all about. To run this installer:

`wget -N https://raw.githubusercontent.com/henroFall/oscar2/master/install_oscar.sh && sudo chmod +x install_oscar.sh && sudo ./install_oscar.sh 

His code is under the GNU GPLv3 License, so this is as well.
